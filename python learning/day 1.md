1. Introduction 
  	•	Simple and easy to learn
	•	Portable (code runs on different systems without changes)
	•	High-level language (human-readable syntax)
	•	Developed by Guido van Rossum
	•	Free and open-source language
	•	Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
	•	Huge libraries (built-in and third-party modules)
	•	Cross-platform (runs on Windows, Linux, macOS)
(Python is a simple, high-level, interpreted, open-source language used for automation, development, and DevOps.)

**Python character set**
- Letters (A-Z , a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special Symbols (  +, -, * etc)
- White Spaces ( blank space, new line, formfed, tab, carriage return)
- Other Characters ( ASCII and UNICODE)

**Variable**
- A Varible is a name given to a memory location in a program.
- python is case sensitive. 

**Rules for identifiers**
	1.	Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore (_)
	2.	Can contain letters, numbers, or underscores after the first character
	3.	Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age)
	4.	Cannot be a Python keyword (class, def, etc.)
	5.	No spaces or special characters (-, @, !, etc.)
	6.	Single or double underscore (_ or __) is allowed for special purposes

**Basic Data types**
1. integer 
2. float
3. string
4. Boolean
5. None 

**Python keywords**
- keywords are reserved word in python 
(False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield)

**python commets in python**
1. Single line (start using `#`)
2. Multiline (start using """ comments """)

**Types of Operators**
1. Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%(modulo), **(to asign power of any digit))
2. Relational Operators  (to compare values )( ==, !=,>,<, >=, <=)
3. Assignmemt Operators ( =, +=, -=, *=. **=, %=, /=) eg.. num=10 -> num += 10
4. Logical Operators (and, or, not)

**Type conversion**
- to convert one type of variable into another type of variable. 
1. Type conversion (automatic or implicit)
2. type casting (manual) eg. A = varible_type(variable value)

**Input in python**
- input() statement is used to accecpt values from user 
- result for input() is always a str
- if user need specific variable use : data_types(input(....))
